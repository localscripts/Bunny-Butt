## Issues, Fixes, and FAQs

### **Mouse shakes a little in Semi-Rage mode**
- This is normal. The shake occurs because the aimbot alternates target areas to avoid consistent headshots. If you'd prefer more stable aiming, switch to the **Legit** configuration, which targets the root part. Alternatively, try adjusting `AIMBOT -> MISC -> MOUSE METHOD`. For further improvements, consider using **Bloxtrap**.

### **Aimbot locks onto teammates**
- Unfortunately, without LUA scripts, this can't be entirely fixed. However, you can reduce your FOV to minimize this issue: `AIMBOT -> MODIFIERS -> FOV SIZE`.

### **Is this blatant?**
- Spectators won’t see an exact 1:1 of your movements. They will only see what you hit, and the spectator view is often inaccurate. 

### **Can I get banned?**
- Yes, there's always a risk. If you play more blatant on a new account, the moderation team might overlook it if you are on a good account, assuming you're just skilled. Most bans are manual, requiring people to submit clips to moderators. You most likely won't get banned as its just hard to tell on Semi-Rage with clips only
